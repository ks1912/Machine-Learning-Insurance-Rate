# GUI USED --> SPYDER Notebook

# Packages Used 
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib.pyplot

# Method used is Linear Regression 

# DATASET NAME -->  insurance.csv

Point of view in output
AS FAR AS SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION IS BEING CONCERNED WE CAN NOT EXPECT A VERY GOOD PREDICTION FOR A LARGE AND A VARITY OF DATASET's.

# EXPECTED OUTPUT
For Linear Regression  -->  306082.81493002
For Polynomial Regression  --> 153002.77334568
